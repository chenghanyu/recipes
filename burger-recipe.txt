ingredients
1 1/2 pounds 80 % lean ground chuck
1 teaspoon table salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
Vegetable oil, for oiling grill rack
4 buns and desired toppings


directions
Turn all burners on a gas grill to high, close the lid and heat until very hot, 10 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, break up the ground chuck with your hands in a medium bowl. Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the meat; toss lightly with your hands to distribute the seasonings. Divide the meat into four 6-ounce portions. Gently toss one portion of the meat back and forth between your hands to form a loose ball. Lightly flatten into a patty 3/4-inch thick and about 4 1/2 inches in diameter. Gently press the center of the patty down until about 1/2-inch thick, creating a slight depression in each patty; repeat with the remaining portions of meat.
Scrape the hot grill rack clean with a wire brush. Lightly dip wadded paper towels in vegetable oil; holding wad with tongs, wipe the grill rack. Grill the patties, uncovered, without pressing down on them, until well seared on first side, about 3 minutes. Flip the burgers with a metal barbecue spatula; continue grilling about 3 minutes for rare, 3 1/2 minutes for medium-rare or 4 minutes for medium. Serve immediately.
